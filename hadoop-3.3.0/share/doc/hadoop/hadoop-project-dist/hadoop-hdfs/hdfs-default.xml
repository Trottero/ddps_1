  <description>Determines the class of ReservedSpaceCalculator to be used for
    calculating disk space reservedfor non-HDFS data. The default calculator is
    ReservedSpaceCalculatorAbsolute which will use dfs.datanode.du.reserved
    for a static reserved number of bytes. ReservedSpaceCalculatorPercentage
    will use dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct to calculate the reserved number

  <value>0</value>
  <description>Reserved space in bytes per volume. Always leave this much space free for non dfs use.
      Specific storage type based reservation is also supported. The property can be followed with
      corresponding storage types ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
      For example, reserved space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
      'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
      then dfs.datanode.du.reserved will be used. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
      as described in dfs.blocksize.
      Note: In case of using tune2fs to set reserved-blocks-percentage, or other filesystem tools,
      then you can possibly run into out of disk errors because hadoop will not check those
      external tool configurations.

    total capacity of the data directory in question. Specific storage type based reservation
    is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types
    ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
    For example, reserved percentage space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
    'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
    then dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct will be used.

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.enable</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    If there is a datanode/network failure in the write pipeline,
    DFSClient will try to remove the failed datanode from the pipeline
    and then continue writing with the remaining datanodes. As a result,
    the number of datanodes in the pipeline is decreased.  The feature is
    to add new datanodes to the pipeline.

    This is a site-wide property to enable/disable the feature.

    When the cluster size is extremely small, e.g. 3 nodes or less, cluster
    administrators may want to set the policy to NEVER in the default
    configuration file or disable this feature.  Otherwise, users may
    experience an unusually high rate of pipeline failures since it is
    impossible to find new datanodes for replacement.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.policy</name>
  <value>DEFAULT</value>
  <description>
    This property is used only if the value of
    dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.enable is true.

    ALWAYS: always add a new datanode when an existing datanode is removed.
    
    NEVER: never add a new datanode.

    DEFAULT: 
      Let r be the replication number.
      Let n be the number of existing datanodes.
      Add a new datanode only if r is greater than or equal to 3 and either
      (1) floor(r/2) is greater than or equal to n; or
      (2) r is greater than n and the block is hflushed/appended.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.best-effort</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
    This property is used only if the value of
    dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.enable is true.

    Best effort means that the client will try to replace a failed datanode
    in write pipeline (provided that the policy is satisfied), however, it 
    continues the write operation in case that the datanode replacement also
    fails.

    Suppose the datanode replacement fails.
    false: An exception should be thrown so that the write will fail.
    true : The write should be resumed with the remaining datandoes.
  
    Note that setting this property to true allows writing to a pipeline
    with a smaller number of datanodes.  As a result, it increases the
    probability of data loss.
  </description>
</property>

  <property>
    <name>dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.min-replication</name>
    <value>0</value>
    <description>
      The minimum number of replications that are needed to not to fail
      the write pipeline if new datanodes can not be found to replace
      failed datanodes (could be due to network failure) in the write pipeline.
      If the number of the remaining datanodes in the write pipeline is greater
      than or equal to this property value, continue writing to the remaining nodes.
      Otherwise throw exception.

      If this is set to 0, an exception will be thrown, when a replacement
      can not be found.

  </description>
</property>

<property>
    <name>dfs.blockreport.split.threshold</name>
    <value>1000000</value>
    <description>If the number of blocks on the DataNode is below this
    threshold then it will send block reports for all Storage Directories
    in a single message.

    If the number of blocks exceeds this threshold then the DataNode will
    send block reports for each Storage Directory in separate messages.

    Set to zero to always split.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.max.full.block.report.leases</name>
  <value>6</value>
  <description>The maximum number of leases for full block reports that the
    NameNode will issue at any given time.  This prevents the NameNode from
    being flooded with full block reports that use up all the RPC handler
    threads.  This number should never be more than the number of RPC handler
    threads or less than 1.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.full.block.report.lease.length.ms</name>
  <value>300000</value>
  <description>
    The number of milliseconds that the NameNode will wait before invalidating
    a full block report lease.  This prevents a crashed DataNode from
    permanently using up a full block report lease.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.directoryscan.interval</name>
  <value>21600s</value>
  <description>Interval in seconds for Datanode to scan data directories and

  Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
  in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
  is assumed.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.directoryscan.threads</name>
  <value>1</value>
  <description>How many threads should the threadpool used to compile reports
  for volumes in parallel have.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec</name>
  <value>1000</value>
  <description>The report compilation threads are limited to only running for
  a given number of milliseconds per second, as configured by the
  property. The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting
  a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being
  limited to 100ms, not 25ms.

  Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the
  actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat
  higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%.

  Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only
  values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result
  in the throttle being disabled and an error message being logged. 1000 is
  the default setting.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.heartbeat.interval</name>
  <value>3s</value>
  <description>
    Determines datanode heartbeat interval in seconds.
    Can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
    ms(millis), s(sec), m(min), h(hour), d(day)
    to specify the time (such as 2s, 2m, 1h, etc.).
    Or provide complete number in seconds (such as 30 for 30 seconds).
    If no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.lifeline.interval.seconds</name>
  <value></value>
  <description>
    Sets the interval in seconds between sending DataNode Lifeline Protocol
    messages from the DataNode to the NameNode.  The value must be greater than
    the value of dfs.heartbeat.interval.  If this property is not defined, then
    the default behavior is to calculate the interval as 3x the value of
    dfs.heartbeat.interval.  Note that normal heartbeat processing may cause the
    DataNode to postpone sending lifeline messages if they are not required.
    Under normal operations with speedy heartbeat processing, it is possible
    that no lifeline messages will need to be sent at all.  This property has no
    effect if dfs.namenode.lifeline.rpc-address is not defined.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.handler.count</name>
  <value>10</value>
  <description>The number of Namenode RPC server threads that listen to
  requests from clients.
  If dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address is not configured then
  Namenode RPC server threads listen to requests from all nodes.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.service.handler.count</name>
  <value>10</value>
  <description>The number of Namenode RPC server threads that listen to
  requests from DataNodes and from all other non-client nodes.
  dfs.namenode.service.handler.count will be valid only if
  dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address is configured.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.ratio</name>
  <value>0.10</value>
  <description>
    A ratio applied to the value of dfs.namenode.handler.count, which then
    provides the number of RPC server threads the NameNode runs for handling the
    lifeline RPC server.  For example, if dfs.namenode.handler.count is 100, and
    dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.factor is 0.10, then the NameNode starts
    100 * 0.10 = 10 threads for handling the lifeline RPC server.  It is common
    to tune the value of dfs.namenode.handler.count as a function of the number
    of DataNodes in a cluster.  Using this property allows for the lifeline RPC
    server handler threads to be tuned automatically without needing to touch a
    separate property.  Lifeline message processing is lightweight, so it is
    expected to require many fewer threads than the main NameNode RPC server.
    This property is not used if dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.count is defined,
    which sets an absolute thread count.  This property has no effect if
    dfs.namenode.lifeline.rpc-address is not defined.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.count</name>
  <value></value>
  <description>
    Sets an absolute number of RPC server threads the NameNode runs for handling
    the DataNode Lifeline Protocol and HA health check requests from ZKFC.  If
    this property is defined, then it overrides the behavior of
    dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.ratio.  By default, it is not defined.  This
    property has no effect if dfs.namenode.lifeline.rpc-address is not defined.

  <value>0.999f</value>
  <description>
    Specifies the percentage of blocks that should satisfy 
    the minimal replication requirement defined by dfs.namenode.replication.min.
    Values less than or equal to 0 mean not to wait for any particular
    percentage of blocks before exiting safemode.
    Values greater than 1 will make safe mode permanent.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.safemode.min.datanodes</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>
    Specifies the number of datanodes that must be considered alive
    before the name node exits safemode.
    Values less than or equal to 0 mean not to take the number of live
    datanodes into account when deciding whether to remain in safe mode
    during startup.
    Values greater than the number of datanodes in the cluster
    will make safe mode permanent.

  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.resource.check.interval</name>
  <value>5000</value>
  <description>
    The interval in milliseconds at which the NameNode resource checker runs.
    The checker calculates the number of the NameNode storage volumes whose
    available spaces are more than dfs.namenode.resource.du.reserved, and
    enters safemode if the number becomes lower than the minimum value
    specified by dfs.namenode.resource.checked.volumes.minimum.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.balance.bandwidthPerSec</name>
  <value>100m</value>
  <description>
        Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that each datanode
        can utilize for the balancing purpose in term of
        the number of bytes per second. You can use the following
        suffix (case insensitive):
        k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa)to specify the size
        (such as 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.).
        Or provide complete size in bytes (such as 134217728 for 128 MB).
  </description>

  permitted.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.hosts.exclude</name>
  <value></value>
  <description>Names a file that contains a list of hosts that are
  not permitted to connect to the namenode.  The full pathname of the

  excluded.</description>
</property> 

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.max.objects</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>The maximum number of files, directories and blocks
  dfs supports. A value of zero indicates no limit to the number
  of objects that dfs supports.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.datanode.registration.ip-hostname-check</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    If true (the default), then the namenode requires that a connecting
    datanode's address must be resolved to a hostname.  If necessary, a reverse
    DNS lookup is performed.  All attempts to register a datanode from an
    unresolvable address are rejected.

    It is recommended that this setting be left on to prevent accidental
    registration of datanodes listed by hostname in the excludes file during a
    DNS outage.  Only set this to false in environments where there is no
    infrastructure to support reverse DNS lookup.

  <value>30s</value>
  <description>Namenode periodicity in seconds to check if
    decommission or maintenance is complete. Support multiple time unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.
    If no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.decommission.blocks.per.interval</name>
  <value>500000</value>
  <description>The approximate number of blocks to process per decommission

  <value>100</value>
  <description>
    The maximum number of decommission-in-progress or
    entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that will be tracked at one time by
    the namenode. Tracking these datanode consumes additional NN memory
    proportional to the number of blocks on the datnode. Having a conservative
    limit reduces the potential impact of decommissioning or maintenance of
    a large number of nodes at once.
      
    A value of 0 means no limit will be enforced.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.decommission.backoff.monitor.pending.limit</name>
  <value>10000</value>
  <description>
    When the Backoff monitor is enabled, determines the maximum number of blocks
    related to decommission and maintenance operations that can be loaded
    into the replication queue at any given time. Every
    dfs.namenode.decommission.interval seconds, the list is checked to see if
    the blocks have become fully replicated and then further blocks are added
    to reach the limit defined in this parameter.

  <name>dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds</name>
  <value>3s</value>
  <description>The periodicity in seconds with which the namenode computes 
  low redundancy work for datanodes. Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive),
  as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.redundancy.queue.restart.iterations</name>
  <value>2400</value>
  <description>When picking blocks from the low redundancy queues, reset the
    bookmarked iterator after the set number of iterations to ensure any blocks
    which were not processed on the first pass are retried before the iterators
    would naturally reach their end point. This ensures blocks are retried
    more frequently when there are many pending blocks or blocks are
    continuously added to the queues preventing the iterator reaching its
    natural endpoint.
    The default setting of 2400 combined with the default of
    dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds means the iterators will be reset
    approximately every 2 hours.
    Setting this parameter to zero disables the feature and the iterators will
    be reset only when the end of all queues has been reached.

  <description>Controls how the default block placement policy places
  the first replica of a block. When true, it will prefer the node where
  the client is running.  When false, it will prefer a node in the same rack
  as the client. Setting to false avoids situations where entire copies of

  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes.</description>

  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.checkpoint.check.quiet-multiplier</name>
  <value>1.5</value>
  <description>
    Used to calculate the amount of time between retries when in the 'quiet' period
    for creating checkpoints (active namenode already has an up-to-date image from another
    checkpointer), so we wait a multiplier of the dfs.namenode.checkpoint.check.period before
    retrying the checkpoint because another node likely is already managing the checkpoints,
    allowing us to save bandwidth to transfer checkpoints that don't need to be used.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained</name>
  <value>2</value>
  <description>The number of image checkpoint files (fsimage_*) that will be retained by
  the NameNode and Secondary NameNode in their storage directories. All edit
  logs (stored on edits_* files) necessary to recover an up-to-date namespace from the oldest retained
  checkpoint will also be retained.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained</name>
  <value>1000000</value>
  <description>The number of extra transactions which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart.
  It does not translate directly to file's age, or the number of files kept,
  but to the number of transactions (here "edits" means transactions).
  One edit file may contain several transactions (edits).
  During checkpoint, NameNode will identify the total number of edits to retain as extra by
  checking the latest checkpoint transaction value, subtracted by the value of this property.
  Then, it scans edits files to identify the older ones that don't include the computed range of
  retained transactions that are to be kept around, and purges them subsequently.
  The retainment can be useful for audit purposes or for an HA setup where a remote Standby Node may have
  been offline for some time and need to have a longer backlog of retained
  edits in order to start again.
  Typically each edit is on the order of a few hundred bytes, so the default
  of 1 million edits should be on the order of hundreds of MBs or low GBs.

  NOTE: Fewer extra edits may be retained than value specified for this setting
  if doing so would mean that more segments would be retained than the number
  configured by dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained</name>
  <value>10000</value>
  <description>The maximum number of extra edit log segments which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart. When used in conjunction with
  dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained, this configuration property serves to cap
  the number of extra edits files to a reasonable value.

  <name>dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>The number of volumes that are allowed to
  fail before a datanode stops offering service. By default
  any volume failure will cause a datanode to shutdown.
  The value should be greater than or equal to -1 , -1 represents minimum
  1 valid volume.

<property>
  <name>dfs.image.compress</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>When this value is true, the dfs image will be compressed.
    Enabling this will be very helpful if dfs image is large since it can
    avoid consuming a lot of network bandwidth when SBN uploads a new dfs
    image to ANN. The compressed codec is specified by the setting
    dfs.image.compression.codec.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.image.compression.codec</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.DefaultCodec</value>
  <description>If the dfs image is compressed, how should they be compressed?
               This has to be a codec defined in io.compression.codecs.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.image.transfer.timeout</name>
  <value>60000</value>
  <description>
        Socket timeout for the HttpURLConnection instance used in the image
        transfer. This is measured in milliseconds.
        This timeout prevents client hangs if the connection is idle
        for this configured timeout, during image transfer.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>
        Maximum bandwidth used for regular image transfers (instead of
        bootstrapping the standby namenode), in bytes per second.
        This can help keep normal namenode operations responsive during
        checkpointing.
        A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled.
        The maximum bandwidth used for bootstrapping standby namenode is
        configured with dfs.image.transfer-bootstrap-standby.bandwidthPerSec.
        Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
        in dfs.blocksize.
  </description>
</property>

  <property>
    <name>dfs.image.transfer-bootstrap-standby.bandwidthPerSec</name>
    <value>0</value>
    <description>
      Maximum bandwidth used for transferring image to bootstrap standby
      namenode, in bytes per second.
      A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled. This default
      value should be used in most cases, to ensure timely HA operations.
      The maximum bandwidth used for regular image transfers is configured
      with dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec.
      Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in
      dfs.blocksize.
    </description>
  </property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.image.transfer.chunksize</name>
  <value>65536</value>
  <description>
        Chunksize in bytes to upload the checkpoint.
        Chunked streaming is used to avoid internal buffering of contents
        of image file of huge size.
        Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
        in dfs.blocksize.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.image.parallel.load</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
        If true, write sub-section entries to the fsimage index so it can
        be loaded in parallel. Also controls whether parallel loading
        will be used for an image previously created with sub-sections.
        If the image contains sub-sections and this is set to false,
        parallel loading will not be used.
        Parallel loading is not compatible with image compression,
        so if dfs.image.compress is set to true this setting will be
        ignored and no parallel loading will occur.
        Enabling this feature may impact rolling upgrades and downgrades if
        the previous version does not support this feature. If the feature was
        enabled and a downgrade is required, first set this parameter to
        false and then save the namespace to create a fsimage with no
        sub-sections and then perform the downgrade.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.image.parallel.target.sections</name>
  <value>12</value>
  <description>
        Controls the number of sub-sections that will be written to
        fsimage for each section. This should be larger than
        dfs.image.parallel.threads, otherwise all threads will not be
        used when loading. Ideally, have at least twice the number
        of target sections as threads, so each thread must load more
        than one section to avoid one long running section affecting
        the load time.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.image.parallel.inode.threshold</name>
  <value>1000000</value>
  <description>
        If the image contains less inodes than this setting, then
        do not write sub-sections and hence disable parallel loading.
        This is because small images load very quickly in serial and
        parallel loading is not needed.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.image.parallel.threads</name>
  <value>4</value>
  <description>
        The number of threads to use when dfs.image.parallel.load is
        enabled. This setting should be less than
        dfs.image.parallel.target.sections. The optimal number of
        threads will depend on the hardware and environment.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.edit.log.transfer.timeout</name>
  <value>30000</value>
  <description>
    Socket timeout for edit log transfer in milliseconds. This timeout
    should be configured such that normal edit log transfer for journal
    node syncing can complete successfully.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.edit.log.transfer.bandwidthPerSec</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>
    Maximum bandwidth used for transferring edit log to between journal nodes
    for syncing, in bytes per second.
    A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.support.allow.format</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>Does HDFS namenode allow itself to be formatted?
               You may consider setting this to false for any production
               cluster, to avoid any possibility of formatting a running DFS.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.max.transfer.threads</name>
  <value>4096</value>
  <description>
        Specifies the maximum number of threads to use for transferring data
        in and out of the DN.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.scan.period.hours</name>
  <value>504</value>
  <description>
        If this is positive, the DataNode will not scan any
        individual block more than once in the specified scan period.
        If this is negative, the block scanner is disabled.
        If this is set to zero, then the default value of 504 hours
        or 3 weeks is used. Prior versions of HDFS incorrectly documented
        that setting this key to zero will disable the block scanner.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.block.scanner.volume.bytes.per.second</name>
  <value>1048576</value>
  <description>
        If this is 0, the DataNode's block scanner will be disabled.  If this
        is positive, this is the number of bytes per second that the DataNode's
        block scanner will try to scan from each volume.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.readahead.bytes</name>
  <value>4194304</value>
  <description>
        While reading block files, if the Hadoop native libraries are available,
        the datanode can use the posix_fadvise system call to explicitly
        page data into the operating system buffer cache ahead of the current
        reader's position. This can improve performance especially when
        disks are highly contended.

        This configuration specifies the number of bytes ahead of the current
        read position which the datanode will attempt to read ahead. This
        feature may be disabled by configuring this property to 0.

        If the native libraries are not available, this configuration has no
        effect.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.reads</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
        In some workloads, the data read from HDFS is known to be significantly
        large enough that it is unlikely to be useful to cache it in the
        operating system buffer cache. In this case, the DataNode may be
        configured to automatically purge all data from the buffer cache
        after it is delivered to the client. This behavior is automatically
        disabled for workloads which read only short sections of a block
        (e.g HBase random-IO workloads).

        This may improve performance for some workloads by freeing buffer
        cache space usage for more cacheable data.

        If the Hadoop native libraries are not available, this configuration
        has no effect.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.writes</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
        In some workloads, the data written to HDFS is known to be significantly
        large enough that it is unlikely to be useful to cache it in the
        operating system buffer cache. In this case, the DataNode may be
        configured to automatically purge all data from the buffer cache
        after it is written to disk.

        This may improve performance for some workloads by freeing buffer
        cache space usage for more cacheable data.

        If the Hadoop native libraries are not available, this configuration
        has no effect.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.sync.behind.writes</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
        If this configuration is enabled, the datanode will instruct the
        operating system to enqueue all written data to the disk immediately
        after it is written. This differs from the usual OS policy which
        may wait for up to 30 seconds before triggering writeback.

        This may improve performance for some workloads by smoothing the
        IO profile for data written to disk.

        If the Hadoop native libraries are not available, this configuration
        has no effect.

  <description>
    Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on.
